PROMPT & PROSE Manual
====================================================================================

PROMPT extends the KLEE symbolic execution engine to perform component-level analysis, which 
is known as under-constrained symbolic execution (or lazy initialization in the context of 
symbolic execution). However, PROMPT differs than UC-KLEE by providing a specification 
language, PROSE, that facilitates modeling an environment model that abstracts the 
Application Programming Interface (API) of the system under analysis. PROMPT has been 
developed with the goal of analyzing system software, which is often implemented in C and 
uses low-level memory operations. One of the goals of PROMPT & PROSE is to avoid the need to 
change the code under analysis. However, depending on the goal of the analysis, users may 
still need to develop models of some of the API functions and compile then against the 
analyzed code base.

Assuming that the PROSE API model.txt has been prepared, to run PROMPT:

$ export PROMPT=<full_path_to_build_dir>/bin/klee

$ PROMPT -prose-api-model=model.txt sut.bc

where model.txt is the PROSE API model and sut.bc denotes the bitcode for the system under 
analysis. Examples of model.txt can be found under the PROMPT_examples directory. 
Below we introduce the main features of PROSE. Note that PROMPT has some additional 
command line options that can achieve some of the API modeling rules' side effects. However, 
we recommend the users to prepare a PROSE API model and use it as shown above.

Another goal of PROSE is to minimize the modeling effort by providing a way to specify rules 
that can be applied globally. However, this may lead to an imprecise analysis. So, users can 
also specify rules that involve specific data types and functions. In that case, type and 
function specific modeling rules take precedence over the globally specified modeling rules. 
Below, we explain major components of the PROSE API modeling language.


PROSE allows four types of specifications:

- Global settings
- Data models
- Function models
- Life-cycle

Section 1. Global Settings

In lazy initialization or under-constrained symbolic execution, an important modeling 
decision involves the size of memory region to be allocated for a pointer. It is possible 
that the pointer refers to a single object or an array of objects. So, in general an array of 
the base type with size greater than or equal to one needs to be allocated. If the array size 
is too small, this would lead to false positives. On the other hand, if the array size is too 
large, it would lead to false negatives and to high memory overhead during symbolic 
execution. With these caveats, the user can specify an array size to be applied to any 
pointer that gets lazily initialized using the ``array size <number>'' rule, where 
<number> denotes a positive integer. Users can overwrite this rule for a specific type as 
explained in Section 2 on Data Models.

In PROSE, a function can be modeled either via another function that matches the signature 
and is implemented in C or by specifying how to handle the arguments and the return value, 
which we call the generic approach. If the function is modeled using the generic approach, 
the return value is automatically symbolized.  However, if a modeled function returns a 
pointer-type, the users can specify whether the NULL value should be considered as a 
possible return value by using the ``null return <choice>'' rule, where <choice> can 
be ``on'' or ``off''. Users can overwrite this rule for specific functions as explained 
in Section 2 on Data Models.

Another important aspect of lazy initialization of data structures is how to deal with the 
function pointers. In some cases, the user needs to specify which function to use for a 
specific field of a type. However, in some cases setting a function pointer field to NULL 
works, e.g., if it is about an optional functionality that can be abstracted away. So, users 
can specify whether the function pointers in lazily initialized data structures can be set to 
NULL using the ``init funcptrs to null'' rule. Users can overwrite this rule for a 
specific type as explained in Section 2 on Data Models.

System code often come with inline assembly code. Although users can deal with inline 
assembly via automated assembly lifters, PROSE provides two ways to model inline assembly, if 
needed. The first way is to model the assembly instruction as a side-effect free operation 
and symbolizing the return value, if any, using the ``symbolize inline asm on'' rule. The 
other way is to automatically modeling functions that have inline assembly using the `` model 
funcs with asm <choice>'' rule. The optional `` but_use_original_with_pattern <substring>'' 
still enforces the originals of functions with names that include <substring> and `` except 
<list>'' specifies exceptions to this setting for functions with names matching the list of 
names specified in the comma separated list of strings <list>. The details of modeling such 
functions are subject to other global and type and function specific rules as specified in 
the PROSE API model.

Users can also specify a global approach to dealing with the pointer arguments of functions 
that are modeled using the generic approach. As mentioned above and detailed in Section 3 on 
Function Models, such arguments can be chosen to be havoced (symbolized) to model the 
side-effect of the function in the most abstract sense. Havocing process marks the object 
pointed by the argument as symbolic. However, users can choose to skip or turn on this 
havocing operation for functions modeled using the generic approach with the ``skip 
havocing singletons <choice>' rule, which can be overwritten for specific functions and 
specific arguments as explained in Section 3 on Function Models.

Section 3. Data Modeling

An important aspect of providing a precise context for a component under analysis is 
describing the embedding relationship between data structures. System software utilizes the 
embedding of one struct in another one to achieve polymorphism and code reuse. This 
assumption may be leveraged to use the address of an embedded object to derive a pointer for 
the embedding object, e.g., the container_of macro in the Linux kernel. If a proper context 
is not provided, analysis of such code may lead to false positives and low coverage of the 
code. PROSE allows users to specify such embedding relationship using the ``<ident_1> embeds 
<ident_2>'' rule, where <ident_1> denotes the name of the embedding type and <ident_2> 
denotes the name of the embedded type. If there are multiple fields of <ident_1> of type 
<ident_2> then the one with the lowest index is assumed for lazy initialization purposes.
  
Another type of data modeling has to do with whether the lazy initialized struct type has a 
single instance within the context of the analyzed components. If so, using the same instance 
instead of creating a new instance improves the precision of the analysis. Users can specify 
whether a data type should be treated as a singleton using the ``singleton <ident>' rule, 
where <ident> is the type name.

Finally, users can specify constraints about the fields of struct types. Such constraints 
consist of two parts: the expression and the binding. In the expression part, users can use 
model variables in constraints that involve arithmetic (+, -, *,/), boolean (!), and 
relational operators (>, >=, <, <=, =, !=). These model variables need to be bound to some 
entities in the code using comma separated ``<ident> is <entity>'' clauses. The types of 
entities include the fields of struct types (<ident> field <number>), the arguments (<ident> 
arg <number>) or the return values (returnof <ident>) of functions, and the sizes of arrays 
or pointer fields (sizeof <ident> field <number>). Function pointer fields can be initialized 
through equality constraints in the form of ``(<funcname> = x) where <funcname> is function, 
<var> is <type> field <number>''.


The field and argument numbers start at 0 
and consecutive numbers are used based on the order of their declaration in the function 
signature or in the type definition. These constraints get enforced on the relevant objects 
during lazy initialization, handling of callsites for functions modeled using the generic 
approach, or handling of return instructions that cause transitioning from one life-cycle 
entry to another.


Section 3. Function Modeling

When a software component is analyzed, it is important to capture the key interactions with 
some of the API functions that are critical for achieving the analysis goal. Some of the API 
functions, on the other hand, will not be that critical. So, PROSE provides various ways of 
modeling an API function with different levels of detail.

One way is to implement the model as a C function and specify the modeling relationship with 
the original one using the <ident_1> modeled by <ident_2> rule, where <ident_1> and <ident_2> 
denote the names of the original function and the model function, respectively.

Another way of function modeling in PROSE is by specifying the side effects of the function 
in terms of its return value and the pointer type arguments, which we call the generic 
approach. Return values of functions modeled in this way are always symbolized. However, the 
return value can be constrained as explained in Section 2 on Data Modeling. The pointer 
arguments can be explicitly specified to be havoced by providing the indices of the arguments 
using the rule ``havoc args <number_list> of <ident>''. Another option in the generic 
approach is to symbolize the return value only and skip havocing of all pointer arguments, 
which can be specified using the ``returnonly <ident>''.


An important class of API functions involve memory allocation and deallocation. Such API can 
be modeled in PROSE to abstract away framework specific details. An allocation function may 
either return a pointer to the allocated memory or store the address in a pointer argument. 
Users can use the ``alloc <ident> size_arg <number> init_zero <bool> symbolize <bool>'' the 
argument index (<number>) that specifies the size of the memory allocation, whether the 
allocated memory would be initialized with zeros, and whether the memory would be symbolized. 
To model a deallocation function, one needs to specify the argument that holds the address of 
the memory region to be deallocated using the ``free <ident> memarg <number>' rule, where 
<number> denotes the argument index.

Section 4. Life-cycle Modeling

In a PROSE model, the components under analysis can be specified using a life-cycle model. If 
there is only one component to be analyzed then this can be specified using the ``entry-point 
<ident>'' rule, where <ident> denotes the name of the function to analyze. If there are 
multiple functions to analyze in a sequential order then the sequential composition can be 
specified as a semicolon separated list of life-cycle entries. A life-cycle entry can be just 
a function name, which means that either the return type of the function is void or that 
regardless of the return value the execution will continue with the next function in the 
sequence. If the execution should continue only for certain cases of return values, e.g., 
success cases, then the ``continue if <bound constraint>'' clause should be specified after 
the function name. The bound constraints that are valid in this context are those that 
involve the return values of the functions (``returnof <ident>'') in the life-cycle 
sequence. Alternatively, users can choose to use the ``<ident> [ <number> ]'' rule to 
specify the specific return value, <number>, for which the execution continues. 
Finally, just specifying the name of the function <ident> indicates that the execution 
must continue with the next life-cycle step when the default success return value of 0, 
if any, is returned.

The template model file docs/PROSE_template.txt can be used to write custom API 
specifications. Examples can be found under the PROMPT_examples. README.txt under each test 
directory explains the used features and how to execute the examples. The examples can also 
be executed and checked against the expected test descriptions using the script 
scripts/runAllTests.sh. Any issues are written to testresults.txt under the respective 
directory.

PROMPT currently supports LLVM 3.8. We are planning to support newer versions of LLVM in the 
near future.
